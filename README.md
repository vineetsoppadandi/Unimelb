# Unimelb
My academic projects I have completed at the University Of Melbourne. I have under taken 2 subejcts details as follows.

## ProgramSoftDevel -> Project in Java ##
    * Developed a medium complexity user interactive NIM game using the core JAVA concepts of encapsulation, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), inheritance and polymorphism. Delivered the project on time and achieved an 88% grade.
    * Designed the program based on the project specification; to accept up to 100 unique players, save an offline record of results for a reload and display the top 5 players' score from all the matches.
    * Created UML (Unified Modelling Language) for the program to design my code.
  
## KnowledgeTechnologies/Porj1 -> Implemented the prject in Python ##
    * We had to identify lexical blend words amongst the data set provided by implementing on proven researched methods. 
    * Required us to understand the source data, solution design, and research methodology in identifying the lexical blends and reported the finding methods on the basis of Accuracy, Precesion, and Recall. 
    * Based on the research I designed and implemented a solution as per the project requirements. The project was assessed on the effectiveness of our code and reseach findings gathered from the project, and I earned 85% in grade.
