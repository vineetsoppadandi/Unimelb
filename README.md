# Unimelb
  *   This "Unimelb" repository is to present some of the university academic projects I have completed during my Masters Education at the University of Melbourne.  
  *   I have undertaken two subjects and for each, I have created a repo. details given below

### ProgramSoftDevel -> Project in Java
  *   Developed a medium complexity user interactive NIM game using the core JAVA concepts of encapsulation, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), inheritance and polymorphism. Delivered the project on time and achieved an 88% grade.
  *   Designed the program based on the project specification; to accept up to 100 unique players, save an offline record of results for a reload and display the top 5 players' scores from all the matches.
  *   Created UML (Unified Modelling Language) for the program to design my code.
  
### KnowledgeTechnologies/Porj1 -> Implemented the prject in Python
  *   We had to identify lexical blend words amongst the data set provided by implementing on proven researched methods.  
  *   Required us to understand the source data, solution design, and research methodology in identifying the lexical blends and reported the finding methods based on Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. 
  *   Based on the research I have designed and implemented a solution as per the project requirements. The project was assessed on the effectiveness of our code and research findings reported gathered from the project(research report is available in the same repo. "COMP90049 Knowledge Technologies.pdf"). With my submission, I attained an 85% grade.
